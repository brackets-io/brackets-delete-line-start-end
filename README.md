Brackets Delete to Line Start/End extension
===========================================

This extension adds two shortcuts to Adobe Brackets, for deleting from the current cursor location to the start or end of the current line. These are common Mac shortcuts (Cmd+Delete and Cmd+Backspace) in code and text editing applications such as Sublime Text 2, TextEdit, Eclipse, Chrome (url bar and dev tools), and even MS Outlook.

When deleting to the start of the line, the extension uses a "smart start" algorithm to delete the text but leave any leading whitespace. (Run the command again to delete to the absolute start of the line.)
